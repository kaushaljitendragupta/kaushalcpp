ans 1:in java,Using the new keyword is the most
 popular way to create an 
object or instance of the class.
 When we create an instance of the 
class by using the new keyword, 

 we can create in various ways;

 1  Using a new keyword.
2  Using the newInstance () method of the 
Class class.
3  Using the newInstance() method of the
 Constructor class.
4  Using Object Serialization and
 Deserialization.
5  Using the clone() method.

ans 2: The new keyword in Java instantiates a class by
 allocating desired memory for an associated new object. 
It then returns a reference to that memory. Many times,
 the new keyword in Java is also used to create the array
 object. The new keyword is followed by a call to a
 constructor, which instantiates the new object.

ans 3:There are three types of variables in Java:
 Local, Instance, and Static

ans 4:Local variable: This is a variable that is declared
 inside the body of a method. Instance variable: This Java 
variable is defined without the STATIC keyword, but as 
outside of a method declaration. They are object-specific 
variables, which is why they are known by this name.

ans 5:Instance variables are created during the creation of 
an object in the heap memory(Heap is the part of the memory 
that is allocated by the JVM that is shared among all
 the threads of the java program) 

ans 6: In Java, method overriding occurs when a subclass 
(child class) has the same method as the parent class. 
In other words, method overriding occurs when a subclass
 provides a particular implementation of a method declared 
by one of its parent classes
