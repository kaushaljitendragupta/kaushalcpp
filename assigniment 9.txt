ans 1:
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number 
of values of a single type. The length of an array is
 established when the array iscreated. After creation,
 its length is fixed.

ans 2:
one d array;
type var-name[];
OR
type[] var-name;

two d array;
// Syntax 
       int [][] arr= new int[3][3];
      // 3 row and 3 column

ans 3:
Size of an array
If you create an array by initializing its values directly,
 the size will be the number of elements in it. Thus the size
 of the array is determined at the time of its creation or, initialization 
once it is done you cannot change the size of the array.;

ans 4:
Yes. We can declare an array without
 size but before using it needs to be initialized.
ans 5:
Doing this, java will assign the default value 0 to each 
element of the array in the case of an int array. Similarly,
 in the case of a boolean array, it will be false, in the case
 of a String array the default value is null in java, and in the
in case of a char arry the default value is unicode (\000).
ans 6:

A one-dimensional array in Java is a collection of similar types of elements
 stored at contiguous memory locations. The data is stored in a continuous manner,
 which makes operations like search, delete, insert etc., much easier.

Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. One dimensional arrays can store
 multiple values of the same primitive type such as int, float, long,
 String, etc. or objects of the same class.
 case of a char array, the default value is Unicode (\u0000).
int number[]; // array declared
    number = new int[10]; // allocating memory, initialization
    number[0] = 11;
    number[1] = 22;
    number[2] = 33;
    number[3] = 44;
    number[4] = 55;
    number[5] = 66;
    number[6] = 77;
    number[7] = 88;
    number[8] = 99;
    number[9] = 100;
ans 7:

import java.util.Scannner;
public class Main{
public static void main(string[] args){
int number[][]={{5,6},{7,6}};
system.out.println(number[0][1]);
}

}
